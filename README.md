**Task: Linear Regression on Housing Prices**

This task implements linear regression to predict housing prices based on essential features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The California Housing Dataset serves as the benchmark for real-world housing price prediction.

## Task Highlights:

**Data Preparation and Exploration:**

* Utilize the California Housing Dataset, which contains various features related to housing prices.
* Explore key features such as:
   * Median income
   * Average rooms per house
   * Location-related variables
* Assess the influence of these features on housing prices.

**Preprocessing:**

* Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to evaluate model performance.
* Standardize features using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

**Model Implementation:**

* Develop a Linear Regression model using the LinearRegression module from Scikit-learn.
* Train the model on the scaled training dataset to predict the median house value.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* Achieve the following results:
   * Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the prediction accuracy.
   * RÂ² Score: Captures the proportion of variance in housing prices explained by the model.

**Visualization:**

* Generate an insightful plot comparing actual vs. predicted housing prices, showcasing the following:
   * Model performance
   * Alignment of predictions with actual values

**Feature Analysis:**

* Analyze feature importance through model coefficients.
* Identify the most influential variables in determining housing prices.

## Key Achievements:

* Delivery of a practical solution to a core machine learning problem in the real estate domain.
* Building a robust prediction pipeline, encompassing the following:
   * Preprocessing
   * Model training
   * Evaluation
   * Feature analysis
* Gaining valuable insights into the relationships between housing features and prices.
* Effectively visualizing findings for better interpretability and communication.
